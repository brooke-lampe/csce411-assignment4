a) For all persons of Nebraska, find their immediate friends:

MATCH path = (person1:Person)-[:FRIEND_WITH]->(person2:Person)
WHERE person1.state = "Nebraska"
RETURN path


b) For all persons of Nebraska, find their immediate friends since 2005.

MATCH path = (person1:Person)-[rel:FRIEND_WITH]->(person2:Person)
WHERE person1.state = "Nebraska" AND rel.year >= "2005"
RETURN path


c) For all persons of Nebraska, find the persons who have the maximum number of immediate friends since 2005.

MATCH (person:Person)-[rel:FRIEND_WITH]->(friend:Person)
WHERE person.state = "Nebraska" AND rel.year >= "2005"
WITH person, count(friend) AS cnt
WITH MAX(cnt) AS maxcnt
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:FRIEND_WITH]->(f:Person)
WHERE p.state = "Nebraska" AND r.year >= "2005"
WITH p, maxcnt, count(f) AS c
WHERE c = maxcnt
WITH p.id AS id
MATCH path = (p)-[r:FRIEND_WITH]->(f)
WHERE p.id = id AND r.year >= "2005"
RETURN path


d) Find the persons who have the maximum number of immediate friends.

MATCH (person:Person)-[:FRIEND_WITH]->(friend:Person)
WITH person, count(friend) AS cnt
WITH MAX(cnt) AS maxcnt
MATCH path = (o)-[:FRIEND_WITH]->(f)
WHERE size((o)-[:FRIEND_WITH]->()) = maxcnt
RETURN path
